# Jasmine Matchers for React

This repository adds some convenient custom matchers for React to the [Jasmine testing framework](http://jasmine.github.io/).
It extends the awesome collection of general purpose matchers [Jasmine-Matchers](http://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers) by Jamie Mason.

**Beware:** This package has just been released with an incomplete set of matchers and without tests.
It will be extended soon.
Feel free to contribute!
